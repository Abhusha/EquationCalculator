# EquationCalculator

This is a 1st assignment of one of my modules - .Net application Development.
In this assignment, I have saved a sample equation so that you can see what happens in every step. 
I have tried to auto correct, in case multiple operators are entered by mistake. (We cant use multiple operator simultaneously in a Equation)
Enjoy the detailed programming !! 

P.S Hope you still remember the BODMAS rule.
