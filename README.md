# EquationCalculator

This is a 1st assignment of one of my modules - .Net application Development.
In this assignment, I have saved a sample equation and printed output after each step is completed ... 
I have tried to use auto correct to avoid the use of multiple operators by mistake. We cant use multiple operator simultaneously in a Equation.
An equation cant end with an operator. I have tried to fix that too. I could have printed " Error Input" but just an experiment. 
Enjoy the detailed programming !! 

P.S Hope you still remember the BODMAS rule.
